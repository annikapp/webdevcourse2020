          <em>Ambitious Wed Devver and <strong>Extreme</strong> <a href="https://instagram.com/doodle_noodles97">doodler</a></em>

        <p>
          I like to doodle often , help others and find solutions to problems that others cant
          I dont like to interact too much with people in person, so I like to rather learn everything on my own online with
          as little human contact as possible
          With that being said, if you are my friend you would hardly believe this! My personality then transforms from a
          creative introvert to a very loud and silly extrovert!
          The term for someone who identifies with both an introvert and an extrovert is called <em>an ambivert</em>!
          I also require a term for someone who is both an absolute pain-in-the-butt when it comes to instructions & organizing
          but also a loud, all-over-the-show creative!
